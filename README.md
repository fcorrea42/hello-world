# hello-world

Hello fellow Hitchhikers!

fcorrea42 here. I like AngularJS, Python (and Monty, too), game development (SEGA, one day I'll be there!) and coffee.
I would like to try the coffee made from the machine on the Heart of Gold spaceship, even if it's garbage anyways, just to say to everyone I drank coffee on improbability speed.
By the way, what's the airspeed of an unladen swallow?
